//Scala notes

//intro.scala
//basics
//scalable programming language //it is a modern multiparadigm
//programming language designed to express common programming
//patterns in a concise ,elegant and type safe way //written by Martin Odersky at EPFL
//1. Statically typed--
//in statically typed language a variable has type and can hold only values of that type I/so if we need to declare a variable then we need to declare its type for every variable 
//that means type error are caught by compliler and not during run time
//scala is statically typed but it also uses type interfacing i.e it figures out the type 50 1â‚¬
//2.runs on jvm full inter-op with java 
//we can use any java code in scala and vice versa
//3. object oriented
//4. functional
//5. dynamic features
//6. scala blends object oriented and functional programming in a statically typed language
//there are no null pointer exceptions in scala compared to java I/scala is not a interpreted language it is a compiled language

//why use scala?
//1. can be used as drop in replacement for java //2. Mixed scala/java projects
//3.uses existing java libraries
//4.uses existing java tools(Ant,Maven, Junit etc....)
//5. Decent IDE support(netbeans, eclipse, intellij,vs)

//SBT
//sbt is scala build tool formerly simple build tool is an open siurce build tool for scala and java //projects similar to java's maven and ant
//sbt is a modern build tool while it is written in scala and provides many scala convienences it is a //general purpose build tool
//sbt is the de facto build tool in scala

//why sbt?
//1. native support for compiling scala code
//2.uses apache ivy for dependency mangement--it also supports mave //3.only update on request model
//4. full scala language support for creating tasks //5. support for mixed java/scala projects
//6. launch REPL(read-eval-print Loop) in project context
